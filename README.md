     Hi! i am Jeremiah Abdulsalam (Aka Orlando(The Maker)). I am a developer from Nigeria.
	My first programming language was Python Programming Language, and i started in 2019 and ever since, i just can't seem to stop using her.
	I am 23, and during the past years, i've built amazing tools for penetration testers.
	check out my website for africa <a href='http://hiddenafrica.42web.io/navigator.html?i=1'>here (Firefox Browsers Only)</a>.
	
	Most of the pentesting tools i made were basic port scanners, network analyzers etc.
	
	I'm not that great at UIs but more efficient with terminal based scripts,it's why i love python.
	I love coding. When i think of ten years from now, i still see myself writing code and loving it even more.
